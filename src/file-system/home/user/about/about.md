# Hi there

My name is Dhaarsan SP, I'm a passionate web developer and full stack software engineer. I have a strong interest in technology and design, from software engineering & machine learning to UI/UX & 3D graphics.

In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in education, history, economics and politics.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed.
